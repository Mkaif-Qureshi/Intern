                            Every year, millions of pieces of secondhand furniture go to waste. That’s why we’re buying back your used Ayatrio furniture, to give chairs, shelves or chests of drawers as many lives as possible.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-justify px-3 opacity-90 mb-3">
                            With the Ayatrio Sell-back program, Ayatrio Family members can receive in-store credit and give unwanted furniture a second life. This way you allow someone else to enjoy your second-hand Ayatrio furniture instead of having to buy something brand new.
                        </p>
                        <p className="text-justify px-3 opacity-90 mb-3">
                            What your used furniture is worth will vary, but you’ll get more in-store credit for pieces that are in better condition or like-new.
